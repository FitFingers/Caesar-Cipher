# Caesar-Cipher
A Caesar Cipher project in the MVP stage that I made for the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms coursework.

----------

In this project I gave no attention to visual styling but rather focused on trying to keep tidy JavaScript. What was originally a clunky caps-only for-loop solution using an alphabet array, and then a '.split("").replace("<caps>").replace("<lowercase>").join("")', I managed to slim down to a few tidier functions.
