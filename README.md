# Caesar-Cipher
A Caesar Cipher project I made for the freeCodeCamp JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms coursework.

----------

In this project I gave no attention to visual styling but rather focused on trying to keep tidy JavaScript.
What was originally a clunky caps-only for-loop solution using an alphabet array, and then a '.split("").replace("").replace("").join("")', I managed to slim down to a few tidier functions.
