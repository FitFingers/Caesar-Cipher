# Caesar-Cipher
A Caesar Cipher project I initially made as coursework for my JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms certificate and revamped afterwards with brand new code and different styling.

----------

In this project I gave no attention to visual styling but rather focused on trying to keep tidy JavaScript.
What was originally a clunky caps-only for-loop solution using an alphabet array, and then a '.split("").replace("").replace("").join("")', I managed to slim down to a few tidier functions.
My original coursework code is in the v0.1.0.js file.
